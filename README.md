**Abstract:**
*Objective* Huntington’s disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder for which there are currently no effective disease-modifying treatments. Despite recent evidence of gut microbiome disruption in preclinical and clinical HD, its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions has not yet been explored.  

*Design* Using the R6/1 transgenic mouse model of HD, we investigated whether fecal matter transplant (FMT) that returns the HD gut microbiome towards a wild-type (WT) profile could be therapeutic. We assessed FMT impacts on the onset and progression of disease. 

*Results* This study reveals an inefficiency of engraftment of the WT microbiota especially in HD males, which is potentially due to the changes of the structure, composition and instability of the gut microbial community, and the imbalance in acetate and gut immune profile found in these HD mice. We have also demonstrated gut dysfunction in the late stage of the HD phenotype, and found it to be sexually dimorphic, and more pronounced in HD males. Finally, despite engraftment inefficiencies, FMT interventions were able to modulate cognitive outcomes in HD. 

*Conclusion* These results demonstrate a progressive and sexual dimorphic gut microbial dysfunction in HD mice and response to gut microbial interventions. There is a potential role for gut microbiome modulation to improve cognitive outcomes in HD. Our results raise opportunities for FMT as a potential therapeutic intervention for HD, influencing gut stability and gut immune profile and paving the way for FMT and other forms of gut microbiome modulation as potential clinical interventions.
